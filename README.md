<h2>Prototype and Progress</h2>
<p>Pilly is continually evolving, with our current focus on a prototype reader designed to minimize manual data entry. By capturing an image of your medication label, the app pre-fills information, only requiring you to set reminder times and days. Although this feature is still under refinement, it represents a significant leap towards our goal of effortless medication management.</p>
